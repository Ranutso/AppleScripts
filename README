AppleScripts repository
â„— 2017 Andre Godoi

SUMMARY

This is a simple repository for my AppleScript files. They are not really related to each other, each script is meant for a different purpose. As it is usual with AppleScript, they are meant to automate things related to Apple products and macOS.

FILES

Mail Filter.applescript: This is meant to run as a scheduled job that backups your messages to a backup mailbox. Since Apple Mail won't automatically move messages from one mailbox to another, this script is meant to accomplish this task.

Mail Filter Amazon.applescript: This is the same as previous script, but it was customized to comply with Amazon's mailbox retention policies.
